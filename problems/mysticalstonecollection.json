You have a list of stone energies given as integers, and you can collect stones in a way that maximizes the total energy collected. You are only allowed to collect stones that are positioned such that no two collected stones are adjacent. Your task is to determine the maximum energy you can collect. Each stone is represented by its energy level. The first line of input contains one integer `n` representing the number of stones. The second line contains `n` integers, where each integer is the energy level of a stone. Output the maximum energy that can be collected. Assume `n` is at least 1 and at most 100.\n\n## Example 1\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n9\n~~~\n\n## Example 2\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\n4\n10 20 5 15\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n25\n~~~"}
