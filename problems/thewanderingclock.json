Assume each minute corresponds to a movement of 6 degrees. The input will be a string in the format `HH:MM`. The output should be a single integer representing the degrees. The hour `HH` is between `00` and `23`, and the minute `MM` is between `00` and `59`.\n\nEach minute represents a 6-degree movement of the minute hand. For example, at `03:15`, the minute hand has moved 15 minutes past the hour, resulting in a 90-degree movement.\n\n## Example 1\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\n00:00\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n0\n~~~\n\n## Example 2\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\n03:15\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n90\n~~~"}
