The sequence is formed by concatenating the number n with itself m times, and then summing up all the digits of the resulting number. The task is to output the sum of the digits of this mystical sequence. For example, if n is 3 and m is 5, the sequence will be 33333, and the sum of its digits is 15.\n\n## Example 1\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\n3\n5\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n15\n~~~\n\n## Example 2\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\n2\n3\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n6\n~~~"}
