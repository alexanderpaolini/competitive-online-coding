The stones have a peculiar property: they can reverse their order when a specific incantation is uttered. The incantation requires you to reverse the order of a subset of these stones, starting from the first stone up to a given position. The task is to determine the order of stones after this incantation is performed.\n\nYou will receive two lines of input. The first line contains 'stone' followed by an integer n, indicating the number of stones to reverse. The second line contains a sequence of integers representing the stones. Your output should be the sequence of stones after the first n stones have been reversed.\n\nEnsure that there are no additional spaces or new lines in the output.\n\n## Example 1\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\nstone 3\n2 1 4\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n4 1 2\n~~~\n\n## Example 2\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\nstone 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n5 4 3 2 1\n~~~"}
