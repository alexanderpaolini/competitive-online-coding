    "description": "\n# The Palindromic Time Converter\n\nGiven a 24-hour formatted time, find the next time that is a palindrome when read forwards and backwards. The time is given as input in the format HH:MM. If the input time is already palindromic, return the same time. The palindrome is checked using the time format itself (ignoring the colon). Every time is valid between 00:00 and 23:59. Your task is to output the next palindromic time. The time should wrap around if necessary (i.e., after 23:59, it should go back to 00:00).\n\n## Example 1\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\n11:11\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n11:11\n~~~\n\n## Example 2\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\n02:30\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n03:30\n~~~"
