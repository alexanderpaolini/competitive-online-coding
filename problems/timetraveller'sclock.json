Your task is to output the new time in the same 24-hour format on a new line. The output should not contain any extra spaces or new lines other than what is necessary.\n\n- Constraints: \n  - 0 ≤ H < 24\n  - 0 ≤ M < 60\n  - 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000\n\n## Example 1\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\n14 35\n120\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n16 35\n~~~\n\n## Example 2\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\n23 50\n15\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n0 5\n~~~\n"}
