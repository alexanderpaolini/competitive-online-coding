The string consists of lowercase English letters only. For example, in the string 'abcabc', the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' each appear twice, so the output should be 0 because no characters appear an odd number of times. In contrast, for 'xyzzyx', the characters 'x' and 'z' appear twice, while 'y' appears twice as well, so the answer is 0.\n\n## Example 1\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\nabcabc\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n0\n~~~\n\n## Example 2\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\nxyzzyx\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\n0\n~~~\n\n## Constraints\n\n- The input string will contain only lowercase English letters.\n- The length of the input string will be between 1 and 1000 inclusive."}
