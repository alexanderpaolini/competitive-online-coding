Your task is to decode a secret signal by rearranging the characters vertically from each string to form new words. The output should consist of as many new words as the length of the strings, each word being constructed by taking the ith character from each string in order.\n\n## Example\n\nInput:\n\n~~~txt\n3\nabc\nxyz\npqr\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~txt\nayp\nbqz\ncxr\n~~~\n\nEach line of the output represents the characters taken vertically from the input strings."}
